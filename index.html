    <h1>Ryan Lindberg</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Ryan, a Junior at UCSD persuing a Bachelors in Data Science. I started my journey in the small town
        of Redmond, Oregon.
        Times were tough there. I failed the majority of my high school classes because I didn't care to show up, and I
        never thought in a million years I would go to college.
        But I'm smart, and I didn't want to throw that away. So I decided that I needed to make use of the opportunities
        available to me, try my absolute best, and do things I was afraid of.
        I left high school with a 4.5 gpa in my senior year (compared to 2.0 my freshman and sophomore years).
        2 years later I graduated with an AS in Data Science from Santa Barbara City College with a 3.92 GPA.
        And now Im here at UCSD. I never thought I would make it this far, but I am so happy to be here, and I love what
        I do! I plan to pursue a masters in the field and possibly a PhD.</p>
