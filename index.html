    <p class='bio'>Hello! I'm Ryan, a senior at UC San Diego studying Data Science. I always loved math and computers as a kid and began
        playing around with programming at the age of 17. I started out at Santa Barbara City College,
        where I earned an Associate's degree in Data Science with a 3.92 GPA, and now I'm continuing my journey at UCSD.
        I'm especially interested in the aspects of data science that we can use to make a positive impact in society. I find 
        the business side of data science to be a little... shallow. What do you mean you want me to optimize the exploitation of the
        general public?! I am very passionate about the cyber security and privacy/ethics side of data, as well as the intersection of data science and biology with bioinformatics.
        These two fields have been at the forefront of my interests for a while now, and I'm excited to see where they take me.
        Recently, I've been diving into bioinformatics with my most recent project and I feel incredibly lucky and grateful to be pursuing
        something I love. Oh and I programmed this website myself, no template!</p>
