    <p class='bio'>Hello! I'm Ryan, a Junior at UC San Diego studying Data Science. I've always loved solving problems and
        building
        things with code, which led me to pursue this field seriously. I started out at Santa Barbara City College,
        where I earned an Associate's degree in Data Science with a 3.92 GPA, and now I'm continuing my journey at UCSD.
        I'm especially interested in data engineering, visualization, and the low-level mechanics that make complex
        systems work. I plan to pursue a master's degree after graduation, and possibly a PhD down the line. I feel
        incredibly lucky to be doing
        something I love, and I'm excited for what comes next.</p>
